1. What are various way to add images into our app? Explain with code examples?

Using img logo
<img src="url" alt="" />

using import
import image from "./public/image.jpg"

const displayData = () => {
    return(

    )
}

2. What would happen if we do console.log(useState())?
We will be getting an array with first index as undefined value and second index as a function which has name
bound dispatchSetState

3. How will useEffect behave if we dont add dependency array?

=> If we dont add a dependency array, the cb function in useEffect will be executed every time the component is rendered and re-rendered 
useEffect(() => {})

=> If we add dependency array and is empty, the callback function will be executed only one time during the initial render of the component.
useEffect(() => {},[])

=> If we add dependency array with value in the array, the cb function will be executed one time during the initial render of the component and also rerender if there is a change in the condition.
useEffect(() => {},[value])

4. What is SPA?
The SPA is known as single page application which is used to dynamically updates the webpage with data from web server without reloading/refreshing the entire page

5. What is difference between client-side and server-side routing?
In client side routing, during the first load, the webapp is loaded from server to client, after which whenever there is a change in URL, the router library navigates the user to the new page without sending any request to backend. All Single Page Applications uses client-side routing.

In server-side routing, every change in URL, http request is made to server to fetch the webpage, and replace the current webpage with the older one.
